# TensorFlow element detector

### Description:

Experience the power of machine learning with my TensorFlow Element Detector web application. Leveraging the cutting-edge TensorFlow.js library and the Coco-SSD model, this project pushes the boundaries of what's possible with web-based machine learning.


### Technologies Used:

HTML: The backbone of the web application, providing the structure and layout.
CSS: Styling elements to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: The scripting language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to the application.
TensorFlow.js: Harnessing the capabilities of machine learning directly in the browser for real-time object detection.
Coco-SSD Model: A pre-trained model for recognizing and identifying objects in images.

    <!-- Import TensorFlow.js library -->
